slim
====

"slim" is a minimal, cross-platform (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows) set of files comprised of common functionality. It is written to C99, but not very strictly. 

It includes the following "modules":

- xlib - Dynamic / Shared Library handling
- xlog - Simple logging functionality; supports multiple "log handlers"
- xnet - BSD-socket like interface across platforms
- xstr - Compact ANSI C-string interface
- xthread - Basic support for threads and mutexes; probably needs additional work
- xtime - Simplified interface to high-performance timers
